# Visually Impared - A repository by students
This repository is created under the name of JettM9104 (Jett) and Mattyar for a science odyssey project using an Arduino UNO.

## What is this?
Ah yes, a great question. This repository is for the code for a project. The goal of this project is to help those who are visually impared by creating a sound once the SONAR sensor detects something within its proximity.

## Parts required
You need a SONAR Sensor, a Button, an Arduino UNO R3, and a buzzer.

## Accessing Code
You can at least one file in one of the dated folders

## Compiling and Uploading Code
Remove the ```c
#include "arduino.h``` header file in each file because it is designed to compile without the IDE. Upload it through Arduino IDE then watch the magic happen
